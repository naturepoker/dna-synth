Another reference script for generating random DNA sequence. 

Simply execute the script followed by length of the DNA you want to synthesize. 

./dna_synth.sh 30000 will return a fasta formatted file (with a > header) of 3000 bases 

Currently the script exits after providing a breakdown table of the sequence composition. 

I'll add the GC content calculator as well as other features later.
